<h1>Barite Market Size, Demand & Supply, Regional and Competitive Analysis 2025-2031</h1>

The global barite market was valued at USD 991.64 million in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 1,058.92 million by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 1.10% during the forecast period.
The market's expansion is primarily attributed to the steady demand from the oil and gas industry, infrastructure development, and increasing use in the pharmaceutical sector. Despite minor fluctuations in supply due to mining regulations, the long-term outlook remains positive.

<h2>Market Size</h2>
Barite is a naturally occurring mineral composed of barium sulfate (BaSO4). It is known for its high density, chemical inertness, and ability to absorb X-rays and gamma rays. Due to these properties, barite is widely used in oil and gas drilling as a weighting agent in drilling muds. Additionally, it finds applications in paints, plastics, rubber, medical imaging, and radiation shielding. The demand for barite is largely driven by its indispensable role in the energy sector, particularly in deep-water and unconventional drilling operations.
