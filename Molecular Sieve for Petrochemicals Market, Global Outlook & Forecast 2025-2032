Molecular sieve for petrochemicals is an advanced adsorbent material widely used in the petrochemical industry to eliminate impurities and moisture from various petrochemical products. These sieves, often composed of zeolites, have uniform pore structures that enable selective adsorption, ensuring superior quality and stability of petrochemical products. They are crucial in processes such as dehydration, desulfurization, and gas purification.
