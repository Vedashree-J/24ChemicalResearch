Food additive liquid carbon dioxide is a purified form of CO2 used in various food and beverage applications. Primarily, it is utilized in carbonated drinks, where it enhances the fizziness and improves the sensory experience. Beyond carbonated beverages, it plays a crucial role in food processing, storage, and preservation. It helps in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), cryogenic freezing, and controlled atmosphere storage, thereby extending the shelf life of perishable food items. Additionally, it is widely used in decaffeination processes for coffee and tea and in extracting essential oils and flavors from food ingredients.
